# Overlook Hotel Management App

Overlook is a mockup of a hotel management app. I used fetched JSON data and a number of Object, Array, String, and Number prototype methods to manipulate the data. This is my first solo project using webpack. I also used jQuery to add things to the DOM and SCSS for styling.
